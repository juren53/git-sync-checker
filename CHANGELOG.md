# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Orphaned stash warning**: after each status check, repos with leftover stashes (e.g. from a failed stash-sync) show a 📦 indicator appended to the status label, with a tooltip explaining how many stashes were found and directing the user to the Git Info > Stash tab to review them.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Grep tab** in Git Info dialog: interactive search across the repo with a pattern input, an optional file glob to narrow results (e.g. `*.py`), and a Search button; runs `git grep -n --heading` and displays filename headers with matching line numbers and content. Enter key also triggers the search.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **UnicodeDecodeError on Windows**: `run_git_command` now forces `encoding="utf-8"` with `errors="replace"` in all subprocess calls, preventing crashes when git output contains characters outside the Windows cp1252 codepage (e.g. in commit messages, author names, or file content).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **File browser for Git Blame tab**: a Browse… button opens a file dialog rooted at the repo directory; selecting a file converts the path to relative, populates the input, and immediately runs `git blame`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Blame tab** in Git Info dialog: interactive tab with a file path input (pre-filled with the first file from the latest commit) and a Show button; runs `git blame <file>` and displays the full annotated output — commit hash, author, date, and content for every line. Enter key also triggers the lookup.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Log tab** in Git Info dialog: ASCII branch graph showing all branches and their relationships, decorated with ref names (`git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`).

## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Config tab** in Git Info dialog: shows all repo-level configuration settings from `.git/config` (`git config --local --list`).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Tags tab** in Git Info dialog: lists all tags with their one-line annotation or commit message (`git tag -n`); displays `(no tags)` when none exist.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Branches tab** in Git Info dialog: lists all local and remote-tracking branches with short SHA, tracking relationship, and latest commit subject (`git branch -a -vv`).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Remote tab** in Git Info dialog: lists all configured remotes with their fetch and push URLs (`git remote -v`).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Stash tab** in Git Info dialog: lists all stash entries (`git stash list`); displays `(no stashes)` when the stash is empty.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Status tab** in Git Info dialog: full `git status` output showing branch tracking info, staged changes, unstaged changes, and untracked files.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Diff tab** in Git Info dialog: shows unstaged working-tree changes (`git diff`); displays `(no unstaged changes)` when the tree is clean.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Show tab** in Git Info dialog: full `git show HEAD` output including the complete diff patch (file headers, hunks, added/removed lines) for the latest commit.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Info dialog**: click any project name in the main window to open a drill-down dialog showing:
  - **Overview strip**: current branch, tracking branch (upstream ref), HEAD short SHA, and remote origin URL.
  - **"Latest Commit" tab**: full `git show --stat HEAD` output — commit hash, author, date, message, and per-file change stat.
  - **"Log (last 20)" tab**: `git log` in a clean columnar format — short hash, relative date, author, and subject.
  - **Refresh** button to re-run all git queries in place without reopening the dialog.
- Project name in each row is now a clickable underlined button with a pointer cursor and tooltip.
- Added `QTabWidget` to PyQt6 imports.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Help > User Guide** and **Help > Changelog** now open the `.md` files in the system's default markdown viewer/editor instead of an in-app plaintext dialog.
- **Help > About** dialog font scaled up 15% for readability.
- **About dialog system info** made more human-readable: friendlier labels ("Running as", "App location", "Operating System"), compact single-line tool entries, removed hardcoded 9pt font override.
- **README.md** rewritten to reflect all current features, installation methods, usage guide, keyboard shortcuts, and up-to-date requirements.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-22

- Zoom level persists across sessions via QSettings.
- Status bar shows current zoom percentage on change.

### Changed
- Renamed **"Delete"** button to **"Remove"** (button label and all related dialogs).
- **Improved column alignment**: project rows now use a `QGridLayout` instead of independent `QHBoxLayout` rows; name column width is computed dynamically from the longest project name; count column tightened from 80px to 60px.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Theme support** via the ThemeManager module: five built-in themes available — Dark, Light, Solarized Light, Dracula, and GitHub.
- **Theme selector** in Preferences dialog (`Edit > Preferences`); selected theme is persisted in `config.json` and applied immediately on save.
- Theme is applied on startup using Qt Fusion style with a fully customized `QPalette`.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- Version number restored to the window title bar.

- **Help > Changelog**: opens `CHANGELOG.md` in a scrollable dialog.
- **Help > User Guide**: opens `README.md` in a scrollable dialog.
- **Help > About**: full About dialog powered by the `pyqt-app-info` module (`AppIdentity`, `gather_info`, `AboutDialog`), showing app version, description, feature list, and runtime environment details.

### Changed
- Renamed per-project **"Ask Claude"** button to **"Get Help"**.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Ask Claude button** per project row: gathers context (current status, last sync error, uncommitted files, `git status`, recent commits) and calls `claude --print` in a background thread (`ClaudeResponseThread`).
- **Claude response dialog** (`ClaudeResponseDialog`): scrollable, read-only monospace text area showing Claude's suggestion, with Copy and Close buttons.
- Button shows `⏳ Asking...` while the request is in flight and re-enables on completion.
- Graceful error handling for missing CLI (`claude` not on PATH), timeouts (60 s), and non-zero exit codes.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Sync failure status label now reads "❌ Sync failed — ask Claude Code?" to guide users toward help.
- Error message persists as a hover tooltip on the status label after the dialog is dismissed.
- Warning dialog appends "Tip: ask Claude Code to help fix this."
- Tooltip is cleared automatically on the next successful status refresh.
- Updated `.desktop` `Exec` to point to installed binary (`~/.local/bin/git-sync-checker`) instead of `run.sh`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Dirty tree detection**: `check_git_sync` now runs `git status --porcelain` and returns a `dirty` flag; repos with uncommitted changes show a `⚠` indicator next to their status (orange-yellow for synced+dirty repos).
- **Stash-sync dialog** (`DirtyConflictDialog`): when Sync is clicked on a dirty+behind repo, a modal dialog lists the uncommitted files and offers "Stash → Pull → Restore" or "Cancel".
- **`GitStashSyncThread`**: background thread that runs `git stash` → `git pull --ff-only` → `git stash pop`, handling all four outcome combinations (both ok, pull ok/pop failed, pull failed/stash restored, both failed).
- **Persistent logging** (`SyncLogger`): sync events (dirty detections, user decisions, sync results) are appended to `sync_history.json`, capped at 200 entries.
- **History dialog** (`SyncHistoryDialog`): scrollable read-only log viewer, newest-first, with colour-coded event entries; opened via a new "History" button.
- After a successful sync the app triggers a full re-check so dirty state and commit counts reflect the true post-sync state.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Added per-project **Sync** button that runs `git pull --ff-only` in a background thread.
- Sync button is enabled only when a repo is in "Behind" state; disabled otherwise.
- On success the row updates to "✓ In Sync". On failure the button re-enables and a warning dialog shows the error output.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Resolved `PermissionError` on `config.json` when launching from the system menu by resolving the config path relative to the executable/script location instead of the current working directory.

- Added `icons.set_taskbar_icon()` call after `window.show()` to fix Windows 11 taskbar showing default Python icon.
- Added `app.setWindowIcon(icons.app_icon())` at application level in `main()`.
